<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>

<li>1 Medium Cauliflower</li>
<li>1 cup flour + 3 TBS flour</li>
<li>1.5 cups panko breadcrumbs (more if necessary)</li>
<li>1 cup non-dairy milk (plus more if necessary)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
<li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
<li>2 teaspoons dried oregano (or dried herb of your choice)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons Lawrys seasoning salt (okay to do without if you don't have it)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
<li>Oil for brushing [optional]</li>

</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>

<li>Preheat oven to 400F</li>
<li>De-stem cauliflower and chop into small florets. You want to make sure the florets are small enough for bite-size pieces, anything larger won't come out right!</li>

<li>In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup flour, 1 cup non-dairy milk, and half of the spices [so 1 teaspoon of each]. Mix until well combined. The mixture should be like a thin pancake batter. If it is still too thick, add more milk.</li>
<li>On a large plate, add half the breadcrumbs and 3 TBS of flour as well as the remaining half of the spices. Use a fork to combine.</li>
<li>Put cauliflower florets into a huge bowl and then pour the wet mixture over the florets. Using a spoon or your hands, toss to combine so that every floret is coated in the wet mixture.</li>
<li>Now, using your clean hands, take each floret and dredge it through the dry panko breadcrumbs mixture. Then, place it on a lined baking sheet. NOTE: About halfway through, the breadcrumbs will become soggy and no-good. Throw them away and replenish with the remaining half of your breadcrumbs, more spices, and more flour. Continue until all cauliflower is on your baking dish.</li>
<li>Cook cauliflower for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, take the cauliflower out and turn/flip it. At this point, you can use a pastry brush to coat each cauliflower bite with a little bit of oil or you can spray oil on. Feel free to skip this step if you are oil-free.</li>
<li>Cook for 15 minutes more and remove from the oven when the breading is golden brown.</li>
<li>Serve immediately with the dipping sauce of your choice. [1 part vegan mayo to 1 part ketchup or 2 parts maple syrup to 1 part dijon mustard]</li>

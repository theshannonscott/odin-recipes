<h1>Vegan Mac and Cheese</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Who misses Kraft-style shells and cheese? I do, I do. After a long shift at my high school job, I would come home
    famished and down a whole box of Kraft Mac ‘n’ Cheese. Since ditching dairy, I’ve missed that classic shell pasta
    enveloped in creamy, cheddar cheese sauce. But after cracking the code on our vegan cheddar cheese, we immediately
    thought to try it with pasta and it worked perfectly! The resemblance to boxed shells and cheese was uncanny! And it
    tastes like the real deal, too! </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups raw cashews</li>
    <li>2 cups water or less if not using vegan cheese, see Notes</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 (7-oz) bag shredded vegan cheddar cheese, optional</li>
    <li>12 ounces elbow pasta</li>

</ul>
,<h3>Optional breadcrumb topping</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons vegan butter, melted</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>

    <li><strong>Soak the cashews</strong> – Soften your cashews by covering them in boiling water for 5 minutes. I do
        this by heating up water in my tea kettle, and then pouring the boiling water over the cashews in a large glass
        measuring cup. </li>

    <li><strong>Cook pasta </strong> – Cook the pasta according to package instructions, but do not overcook. Drain and
        set aside.</li>

    <li><strong>Blend cheese sauce</strong> – Drain the soaked cashews and discard the soaking water. Add the cashews,
        fresh water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and bag of shredded cheese (if using)
        to a high powered blender and blend until very smooth.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Baked version</h3>
<ol>

    <li><strong>Preheat oven and prep</strong> – If planning on baking it with the breadcrumb topping, preheat the oven
        to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a casserole dish (I used a 9×13 inch dish).</li>

    <li>Make the breadcrumb topping by mixing the breadcrumbs, melted vegan butter and smokedgit paprika in a small bowl
        until crumbly and moist.</li>

    <li>Add the drained pasta to the prepared casserole dish, and pour in the cheese sauce. Stir to coat the noodles.
        Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture on the pasta and bake, uncovered for 15 minutes. I also broiled it for a few
        minutes until golden brown. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Who misses Kraft-style shells and cheese? I do, I do. After a long shift at my high school job, I would come home famished and down a whole box of Kraft Mac ‘n’ Cheese. Since ditching dairy, I’ve missed that classic shell pasta enveloped in creamy, cheddar cheese sauce. But after cracking the code on our vegan cheddar cheese, we immediately thought to try it with pasta and it worked perfectly! The resemblance to boxed shells and cheese was uncanny! And it tastes like the real deal, too! </p>

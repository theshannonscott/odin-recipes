<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Restaurants in Japan tend to be quite different from those in the States. In the US, most restaurants offer a variety of foods cooked through various methods. You're likely to see grilled foods, saut√©ed foods, fried foods, boiled foods, steamed foods, et cetera, all on the same menu. In Japan, it's far more common for a restaurant to specialize in one technique. If you're in the mood for tempura, you'd better hope everyone in your party is, because that's all the restaurant is going to serve.</p>

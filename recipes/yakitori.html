<h1>Yakitori</h1>
<img src="../images/yakitori.jpg" alt="Yakitori" height="800px">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Restaurants in Japan tend to be quite different from those in the States. In the US, most restaurants offer a variety
    of foods cooked through various methods. You're likely to see grilled foods, sautéed foods, fried foods, boiled
    foods, steamed foods, et cetera, all on the same menu. In Japan, it's far more common for a restaurant to specialize
    in one technique. If you're in the mood for tempura, you'd better hope everyone in your party is, because that's all
    the restaurant is going to serve.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<h3>The Sauce</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup mirin</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sake</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tsp brown sugar (packed tightly and leveled off)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chicken Skewers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>9 green onions/scallions</li>
    <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (at room temperature)</li>
    <li>3 tbsp neutral oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>To Make the Yakitori Sauce (Tare)</h3>

<ol>
    <li>In a small saucepan, add ½ cup soy sauce, ½ cup mirin, ¼ cup sake, ¼ cup water, 2 tsp brown sugar, and the green
        part of 1 of the 9 green onions/scallions. Bring it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to
        low and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce reduces to one-third of its original volume. It will take about 30
        minutes. Let it cool to room temperature before using. The sauce will thicken with a glossy shine as it cools.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Tip:</strong> You can make the sauce ahead of time. To store, remove the green onion from the sauce and
        pour into a mason jar. Keep in the refrigerator for up to 2–3 months.<br><br>
    </li>

    <li>Reserve one-third of the sauce in a small bowl for final basting, just before serving. To prevent
        cross-contamination, use this reserved sauce with a clean brush only after the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
</ol>

<h3>To Prepare/Assemble the Yakitori</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Cut the white and light green parts of the remaining green onions/scallions into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces.</li>

    <li>Cut 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs into 1-inch (2.5-cm) squares.</li>

    <li>On a flat work surface, fold each slice of chicken in half, insert a bamboo skewer into the chicken at a
        45-degree angle, and press down on the skewer to pierce the meat through the center.</li>

    <li>Next, add a piece of scallion perpendicular to the skewer. Continue to alternate chicken slices with pieces of
        scallion, ending with a piece of chicken. Each 5-inch skewer will hold about 4 chicken slices and 3 scallion
        pieces.</li>

</ol>

<h3>To Grill/Broil the Yakitori</h3>

<ol>

    <li>Grease the grate of the broiler/wire rack (or oven-safe cooling rack) with <strong>neutral oil</strong> to keep
        the chicken from sticking to the grate. Place the skewers on top of the grate.
    </li>

    <li>Set the broiler to High and wait until the heating elements are hot. Then, place the skewers under the broiler.
        Broil for 6 minutes.
    </li>

    <li>After 6 minutes, brush the meat on both sides with the Yakitori Sauce. Continue to broil for 3–4 minutes to
        caramelize the sauce.
    </li>

</ol>

<h3>To Serve</h3>

<ol>

    <li>Remove the skewers to a serving plate. With a clean brush, baste the top of the chicken skewers with the
        reserved sauce. Serve and enjoy! <br><br>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> If you accidentally cross-contaminate the reserved sauce (by dipping the same brush you
        used on the uncooked chicken during cooking), you will have to boil the sauce again.
    </li>

</ol>
<h3>To Store</h3>

<ol>

    <li>You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the
        freezer for up to a month.
    </li>

    <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>

    <li>Soak about 10 to 12 5-inch bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes.
    </li>

</ol>

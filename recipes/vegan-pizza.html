<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Meet the best vegan pizza recipe! Loaded with broccoli, tomatoes, jalapeño, and creamy cashew sauce, this pizza is flavorful, satisfying, and fun to eat. You’re not even going to miss the cheese! Each veggie adds an interesting flavor and texture, and together, they make a pizza that tastes amazing. The broccoli gets all roast-y toasty, the corn pops with sweetness, the sun-dried tomatoes bring that tangy umami flavor, and the jalapeño brings some spice to this pizza party. The whole thing gets doused in a creamy/savory layer of cashew cream in lieu of any cheese or dairy. It’s a pizza recipe you can feel good about!</p>

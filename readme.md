This is the first project in my journey to be a web designer. Through this project I will be practicing coding with HTML elements in mind. I will be doing this by creating blog style webpages for 5 of my favorite recipes. This project will be updated as I learn more throughout my coding journey. So stay tuned and witness my growth fist hand.
